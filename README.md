# UTD Rooms
Utility tool to find open rooms and get schedules for a room

### How are open locations determined? 
- I scraped data from UTD coursebook (a tool that shows information about class times, professor, and location). So, anytime there is NO lecture happening then the class is probably open. "Probably" because some rooms might be locked.
